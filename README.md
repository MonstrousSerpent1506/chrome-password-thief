 ## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## Inspiration 
+ Mr. robot
+ Social engineering attacks. Assuming python is install (or you convert this to a .exe), you should be able to email yourself chrome passwords, by only pluging in a U3-type usb (or CD) which has autorun. 

## Expansion  

* Make headless 
* convert to a exe, not all computers have python install... very few do.
